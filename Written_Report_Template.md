# Kickstarting with Excel 

 
 

## Overview of Project 

The project involved analyzing and visualizing using Kickstarter Dataset provided to determine how different campaign dared in relative to their launch Dates and their funding goals. This is done firstly by visualizing campaign outcomes using pivot tables based on launch dates and secondly based on the funding amounts 

 
 

### Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize the Fund-raising goal in Kickstarter dataset utilizing the tools excel and visualization using pivot tables and charts 

Included checking on how different campaigns fared in relation to launch dated and their funding goals 

## Analysis and Challenges 

#SCreenshot 

The challenges involved in the projects were the errors in selecting data or filtering process. Other challenge that encountered during the project was with automation of the variables in pivot chart in excel as some variables including years did not appear during some stages of the analysis 

 
 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date 

From the Outcomes based on the launch date it can be observed that the greatest number of outcomes was achieved on May June time and kept decreasing during the year with the lowest number of outcomes achieved during the month of December. When comparing the different times of outcome, the failed outcomes is fairly present although lower than successful outcomes during each month but December marked the month were both the successful and the failed outcomes were almost similar  

 
 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals 

By Analyzing the outcomes based on Goal we can identify that the greatest percentage of outcome achieved is for the Rande of 45000 - 49999 with 80 percentage successful outcomes. And the lowest outcomes achieved is for the amount less than 1000 and between 35000 and 45000. Although the percentage of failed outcomes was lower in the launch date analysis but in the outcomes based on Goal chart, we can observe failed percentage going above the successful percentage for 1000-19999 range and 35000 -44999 range 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered 

 
 

The difficulties encountered during the project ranged forum fixing some random errors during applying excel formulas to fixing the errors formed in the chart and changing the variables in the pivot table. Other possible challenges that could have encountered during the analysis is entering the wrong data and therefore resulting in wrong results even though all the formulas inputted is right 

## Results 

 
 

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 

We can conclude that outcomes based on outcomes based on launch date has successful outcomes throughout the year although May to August was the best possible outcomes achieved. 

While the failed outcome 

 
 
 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? 

Unlike outcomes based on Launch Date, outcomes based on goals had failed outcomes more than successful for certain range of goal, while percentage of cancelled is zero 

 
 

- What are some limitations of this dataset? 

For most of the real data sets there would be incomplete cells in sheets, which we did 'not have to during the project but possible in real life. Also excel can only handle limited number of datasets at a time real life would have to encounter much more for data analysis 

 
 
 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? 

We could create pivot tables and charts based on the different backers count spotlight, percentage funded and average donation.
